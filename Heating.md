Boiler
---
Not 100% sure, but the boiler seems to be Ideal LOGIC+ SYSTEM S18.  
Manual can be found [here](../docs/215353-8-logic-plus-system-user-guide.pdf). Installation and cabling details [here](../docs/https://idealboilers.com/uploads/documents/erp-label-logic-system-s18.pdf).

Aparently this series [supports opentherm](https://idealboilers.com/blog/the-benefits-of-opentherm-connectivity), which would enable fine grain control with the best controllers. Nest, Honeycomb... it would mean throwing the exising one. 


Official system
---
Information about the company running our app for the house heating system.
Aparently the App provider is based on [heatmiser](https://www.heatmiser.com/)

Jail breaking
---
TO be investigated once we have access to the flats.
