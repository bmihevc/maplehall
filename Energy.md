This page contains the different providers for gas an electricity available in Maple Hall

There are two main websites to compare tarifs:

https://www.bonkers.ie/compare-gas-electricity-prices  
https://switcher.ie/gas-electricity/comparison/

Due to the fact that flats have A2/A3 BER energy rating, and a relatively "geek" avg user,
taking into account the National irish averages of:  
4,200 kWh in electricity and 11,000 kWh.

4000 kWh 
7000 kWh

Aparently right now the best tarif is Iberdrola, Dual Fuel 23.  
An aproximated cost of 1260 eur/year, including taxes and all fees. [Iberdrola](https://www.iberdrola.ie/quote/dual-fuel)


Due to the fact that in ireland the ‘night time’ timeframes are very short:
11pm-8am during winter (late October to late March)  
12am-9am during summer (late March to late October).  
I don't think there's possible to make it worth it (maybe electric car)
